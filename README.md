# ascii-art-testfile

This test file will test your ascii art project against the test cases provided on the intra audit page, simultaneously.

The test file and the test output file need to be placed within your project folder, in the same folder as your main.go.

To run the test file you simply need to open a terminal in the project folder and run the following command:<br/>

***go test .***

If your project passed the test the output should be as follows(with a varying amount of time taken):

![success]()

If it did not pass it should be like so:

![failure]()
